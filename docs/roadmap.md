# Roadmap
- OCR-backed head-mode snippets for images.
  - Preferred approach: integrate `rapidocr-onnxruntime` as the local OCR backend (pure Python + ONNX Runtime, good privacy story) with lazy initialization and per-file caching.
  - Open concern: current RapidOCR wheels require `numpy<2`, which conflicts with allowing newer NumPy versions. Until the upstream stack supports NumPy 2.x, we plan to keep OCR optional instead of enforcing the dependency.
  - OCR (image head/full fragment) is still under development. We prefer to integrate with the local `rapidocr-onnxruntime` to avoid uploading the code to the cloud, but this dependency currently requires `numpy<2`. Until RapidOCR/ONNX Runtime officially supports NumPy 2.x, the default distribution will not force OCR to be enabled, to avoid blocking users from upgrading NumPy.
- Additional embedding providers (Azure). 
- Add AST-aware `code` mode chunking for Go and Rust (tree-sitter support).
- TODO: Search performance improvements.
  - Replace SQLite vector blobs with `vectors.npy` + `metadata.json` (memmap) to reuse across searches.
- TODO: API performance improvements.
  - Add process-local embedding LRU cache for long-lived API sessions (query + chunk embeddings, opt-out when `no_cache` is set).
  - Adaptive embedding concurrency based on 429/timeout signals (in-process only; do not persist config changes).
  - Async embedding backends (AsyncOpenAI/Async Gemini) with asyncio concurrency to reduce thread overhead and improve connection reuse.
  - Adaptive embedding batch size for remote providers (guarded by safe min/max and backoff on 429/413).
  - Batch query search API to embed multiple queries per call and reuse loaded index vectors (reduce repeated I/O).
- Evaluate migrating the similarity store to FAISS or another vector database for faster search and scalable metadata filtering.
- Official Vexor API relay service to offload local credentials and speed up indexing.
- VS Code extension integration.
- Project-level local cache (per-folder cache root override).
- Support `.vexorignore` for per-project ignore rules.
