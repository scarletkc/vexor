# Roadmap
- Full-document chunked indexing for long files.
- Keyword-focused indexing mode for requirements/PRDs.
- Additional embedding providers beyond Gemini (OpenAI, Azure, local backends).
- Evaluate migrating the similarity store to FAISS or another vector database for faster search and scalable metadata filtering.
- Official Vexor API relay service to offload local credentials and speed up indexing.
